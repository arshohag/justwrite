# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, *Just Write* collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

*Just Write's* purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how *Just Write's* visitors use its website. From time to time, *Just Write* may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

*Just Write* also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. *Just Write* does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally &mdash identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

*Just Write* is purely a client-side application. This means that servers hosting *Just Write* do not use, save, or retain any personal information given by its users.

Upon logging in through the application, a user submits their WordPress website URL, username and password. These items are used to make an HTTP request to the website provided by the user, in order to receive a [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/) token to identify the user in future request made to their website. This token and user information is then stored within the user's local web browser storage.

## Use of Personal Information

While using the *Just Write* application, user data and the authentication token are referenced from the user's local browser storage. When the user interacts with their WordPress website using *Just Write*, servers hosting *Just Write* are not involved in any handling of said personal data.

HTTP requests from the client-side *Just Write* application are made directly to the user's WordPress website on behalf of the user. The information passed along by the user in this process to verify their identity, is done with the authentication JWS token retrieved from the user's local browser storage.
